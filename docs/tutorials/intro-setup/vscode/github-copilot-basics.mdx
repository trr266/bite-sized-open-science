Welcome to another episode of **Bite-Sized**. In this video, we introduce **GitHub Copilot**, your AI-powered coding assistant inside VSCode.

:::tip[What is GitHub Copilot?]

GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer powered by OpenAI. It suggests code snippets and whole functions based on the context in your file, making coding faster and smarter.

:::

### How to Install and Enable Copilot in VSCode

1. Open the **Extensions** tab in VSCode.  
2. Search for **GitHub Copilot** and click **Install**.  
3. Sign in with your GitHub account when prompted.  
> **Note:** Copilot requires a subscription, but students get free access via GitHub Education.

### Trying It Out – Copilot in Action

Let’s see Copilot help write a function. For example, type this comment:

```python
# Function that prints "Hello, World!"
```

Copilot will suggest the full function automatically. Press **Tab** to accept the suggestion.  
You can cycle through different suggestions using:  

- **Alt + ]** and **Alt + [** (Windows/Linux)  
- **Option + ]** and **Option + [** (Mac)  

### Tips for Using Copilot Effectively

- Use descriptive function and variable names — Copilot reads context.  
- Write comments describing what you want to do; Copilot uses them as hints.  
- Always review suggestions before accepting to ensure correctness.  

:::danger[Keep in Mind]

Copilot assists you but doesn't replace your coding skills. Treat it as a powerful helper, not an autopilot.

### Closing

With GitHub Copilot, you can write code more efficiently and get inspired by AI-powered suggestions.
